  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I am an recently graduated aspiring Software Engineer! I previously studied Games Design and have designed and developed all sorts of games.
    A majority of what can be found here are my games and test projects I made through Uni. However, as I am persuing a career in Software Development you
    should see more projects surrounding it here soon!!
    <br><br> Thanks for dropping by! :)
